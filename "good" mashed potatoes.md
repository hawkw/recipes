the goodest mashed potatoes
---------------------------

+ 3-5 potatoes (depends on the number of souls who want food)
+ one garlic per person (more if they're little garlics, basically what I am saying is, many garlics)
+ not a lot of butter
+ sour cream
+ grated cheddar cheese if you're into that sort of thing

Boil the potatoes until they're soft. Stick forks in them to find out how soft. Pour out the potato water and save it for bread-related purposes (it's starchy and good for breabs). Saute' garlic in the skillet (chop it up first) and add. Smush. Add sour cream until the texture is right. Add butter and NaCL (many).
