Alton Brown's Brownies
======================

Ingredients
-----------

 + Soft butter, for greasing the pan
 + Flour, for dusting the buttered pan
 + 4 large eggs
 + 1 cup sugar, sifted
 + 1 cup brown sugar, sifted
 + 8 ounces melted butter
 + 11/4 cups cocoa, sifted
 + 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
 + 1/2 cup flour, sifted
 + 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

Instructions
------------

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Butter and flour an 8-inch square pan.

In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the eggs at medium speed until fluffy and light yellow. Add both sugars. Add remaining ingredients, and mix to combine.

Pour the batter into a greased and floured 8-inch square pan and bake for 45 minutes. Check for doneness with the tried-and-true toothpick method: a toothpick inserted into the center of the pan should come out clean. When it's done, remove to a rack to cool. Resist the temptation to cut into it until it's mostly cool.

Cara Adds:
----------

+ 1 teaspoon of salt instead of 1/2
